## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

This is a replica of the game "Frogger." The classic arcade came that
was made in 1981 where a frog has to cross various obstacles such
as cars, trains, snakes, and the river and get to the other side.
I decided to add a twist. I love the character Big the Cat from the
Sonic the Hedgehog franchise so I decided to make him the main character
and I associated frogger with him because Big's best friend is a frog
named "Froggy." so I decided to make a game where Big has to cross the
road in order for him to win the game and get his frog friend.


## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned how easy it is to create objects on JavaFx and how most
of the components are relatively similar to that of one another.
I loved creating and writing code where I could use my creativity.
It is so cool how we can create code and functionality to random
images off the internet. How a random picture of big the cat and
random images of cars could create this "Game" where people could 
enjoy.



## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would definetly draw out the component charts. I decided
to write code from scratch thinking that I would understand
what to do; however, things backfired. I wanted to make a
Jetpack Joyride game but the problem with it was that I was 
doing it out of my head rather than really analyzing. For the frogger
idea, I ended up making a component chart which helped me map out
what I should do and how I should make the arcade game.
